Reduce Financial Burden on Government

## **Description**

As we are in lockdown there is severe economial crisis in our country.Here already we are in crisis and again we need to spend now to help people.Many people are willing to help but they don&#39;t know whom to consult and how to help .So,my idea is to provide a platform to the people to help the society in what way they can .

I recognized  **FIVE**  aspects in which people can help Government

- Government is renting function halls and buildings for isolation wards , to give shelter to daily wage workers cam from other states etc.. So if owners of Function  Halls and buildings helped us then our Government can reduce investment on that
- Many people are willing to donate money .Here my idea is to  **localize**  the donation. As many MNC&#39;s,Industrialists,Buisinessmen are donating to Prime Minister, I want people to donate to their states so that their donations will be localized and access to money will be fast.
- Another thing is identifying helpless people and any quarantined people.So,we are seeking help from people to get such information.
- Many universities,institutes can donate medical equipment which will help us to overcome equipment crisis
- Govrnment is spending money for providing food to volunteers, workers and isolated people . Donating food is not a issue for many people so, giving oppurtunity to people who are willing to.

Even a small donation reflects in overcoming this crisis.
